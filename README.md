# Phone Book

This is a console application designed to act as a phonebook for your contacts. As working with .NET's eco-system, I've encountred the use of Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs). I've got the gist that they work as a way to deal with databases that uses objects. Therefore, the goal of this project was to learn how to use Entity Framework as it is one of the most popular ORMs in the .NET eco-system.




## Requirements

- This is an application where contact's name along with their phone numbers are recorded and saved.
- Allow users to Add, Delete, Update, and Read from the database using the console.
- Start the use Entity Framework instead of raw SQL.
- Using the "code first" approach to create the database by using Entity Framework's migrations tool.
## Lessons Learned

- Performing migrations

- Save snapshots of my DbContext

- Change the config of the models depending on db creation time.
## Roadmap

- Change datababase from SQLite to SQL Server

- Add SMTP mail functionality

- Look into a better UI for the app

- Adding exceptions/protection to wrong id inputs
- Twillo API to verify numbers
- Using some sort of API to verify correct email address
- A better search method to display contact (or an individual contact
- Fixing A LOT of DRY
